# Observer Pattern Demo in Python Tkinter

This application demonstrates the Observer pattern using Python and Tkinter. The Observer pattern allows objects (observers) to automatically receive notifications about changes in the state of other objects (subjects). This application allows the user to change the state of the subject through a graphical interface, and observe how the changes affect observers in real time.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run a copy of the application locally for development and experimentation.

### Preliminary Requirements

Before you start, make sure that you have Python version 3.6 or higher installed. Python can be downloaded and installed from the [official website](https://python.org/).

### Installation

First, clone the repository to your local computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zxc228/observer-pattern-app.git
cd observer-pattern-app
```
Then install the necessary dependencies:


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launching the Application
To launch the application, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
python run.py
```
This will start the graphical interface, allowing you to interact with the Observer pattern implementation.
